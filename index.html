<p>Catastrophe theory is the classification of isolated degenerate critical points. The theory is important for a wide range of fields in mathematics and science. However, it can be difficult to get started. While the theorems can be stated in elementary terms, and there are many expositions of the applications, the proofs require a solid foundation in mathematics. In these notes, I will state the main theorems and give a flavour of the underlying mathematics. For a complete, accessible, and rigorous treatment of catastrophe theory I recommend <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Catastrophe-Theory-Second-Edition/Castrigiano-Hayes/p/book/9780813341255">Catastrophe Theory</a> by Domenico Castrigiano and Sandra Hayes to which I will refer in these notes.</p>
<p>A smooth function <span class="math inline">\(f: U \to \mathbb{R}\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> an open subset of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span> including the origin <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{0}\)</span>, has a critical point at the origin when its gradient vanishes at this point, <em>i.e.,</em></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[D f(\boldsymbol{0}) = 
(\partial_1 f(\boldsymbol{0}), \dots, \partial_n f(\boldsymbol{0})) 
=\boldsymbol{0},\]</span></p>
<p>with the partial derivative <span class="math inline">\(\partial_i f = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}.\)</span> The character of the critical point is often determined by the second-order derivative in the form of the Hessian matrix</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[D^2 f(\boldsymbol{0}) = 
\begin{pmatrix}
\partial_{1}^2 f(\boldsymbol{0})  &amp; \partial_1 \partial_2 f(\boldsymbol{0}) &amp; \dots &amp; \partial_1 \partial_n f(\boldsymbol{0})\\
\partial_2 \partial_1 f(\boldsymbol{0}) &amp; \partial_{2}^2 f(\boldsymbol{0})  &amp; \dots &amp; \partial_2 \partial_n f(\boldsymbol{0})\\
\vdots   &amp; \vdots   &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots\\

\end{pmatrix}.
\]</span></p>
<p>The <strong>rank</strong> – defined as the number of independent rows or columns – and the <strong>index</strong> – defined as the number of negative eigenvalues – of the Hessian matrix are independent of the choice of coordinates. That is to say, a coordinate transformation <span class="math inline">\(g(\boldsymbol{x}) = f(\psi(\boldsymbol{x}))\)</span> – with a diffeomorphism <span class="math inline">\(\psi:U \to V\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> open sets in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span> – preserves the gradient, and the rank and index of the Hessian matrix at the critical point,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}

D^2g(\boldsymbol{0}) &amp;=(D \psi(\boldsymbol{0}))^T D^2f(\boldsymbol{0}) (D \psi(\boldsymbol{0})),
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>where the first order derivative of the diffeomorphism <span class="math inline">\(\psi(\boldsymbol{x}) = (\psi_1(\boldsymbol{x}), \dots, \psi_n(\boldsymbol{x}))\)</span> is defined as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[D \psi(\boldsymbol{0}) =

\partial_2 \psi_1(\boldsymbol{0}) &amp; \partial_{2} \psi_2(\boldsymbol{0})  &amp; \dots &amp; \partial_2 \psi_n(\boldsymbol{0})\\

\end{pmatrix}.
\]</span></p>
<p>The rank determines whether the critical points is <strong>degenerate</strong> or <strong>nondegenerate</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> <em>A critical point is <strong>nondegenerate</strong> when the Hessian matrix <span class="math inline">\(D^2 f\)</span> is invertable (the rank <span class="math inline">\(r = n\)</span>). When the Hessian matrix is not invertable, the critical point is <strong>degenerate</strong> (the rank <span class="math inline">\(r &lt; n\)</span>).</em></p>
<p>For a nondegenerate critical point, the index distinguishes between the maximum, minimum and saddle points.</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> <em>A nondegenerate critical point is a minimum when the index <span class="math inline">\(s=0\)</span>, a maximum when the index <span class="math inline">\(s=n\)</span>, and saddle point of index <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(0 &lt; s &lt; n\)</span>.</em></p>
<p>As we will show below, the index of a nondegenerate critical point fully classifies the critical point up to coordinate transformations. For degenerate critical points, both the rank and the index play an important role in the classification.</p>
<h2 id="nondegenerate-critical-points">Nondegenerate critical points</h2>
<p>The classification of nondegenerate critical points is expressed by <strong>Morse lemma</strong>, first proven by Marston Morse in 1934. Note that the theorem was already anticipated by Arthur Cayley (1859) and James Clerk Maxwell (1870) in the study of contour lines in topography.</p>
<p><strong>Morse lemma:</strong> <em>Let <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> be a smooth function of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> variables with a critical point at the origin with index <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>. The critical point is nondegenerate if and only if there exists a local diffeomorphism <span class="math inline">\(\psi\)</span> which preserves the origin <span class="math inline">\(\psi(\boldsymbol{0})=\boldsymbol{0}\)</span> for which</em></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f(\psi(\boldsymbol{x})) =f(\boldsymbol{0}) - x_1^2 - \dots - x_s^2 + x_{s+1}^2 + \dots + x_n^2\]</span></p>
<p><em>in the vicinity of the origin.</em></p>
<p><strong>Proof:</strong> <em>The Morse lemma is proven in many textbooks on function theory. I will here simply refer to chapter one of <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Catastrophe-Theory-Second-Edition/Castrigiano-Hayes/p/book/9780813341255">Catastrophe Theory</a> by Domenico Castrigiano and Sandra Hayes.</em></p>
<p>In the one-dimensional case, the lemma states that any nondegenerate critical points at the origin is either locally equivalent to a maximum <span class="math inline">\(f =f(0) -x^2\)</span> or a minimum <span class="math inline">\(f= f(0) + x^2\)</span> (see figure 1).</p>

<p>More generally, the lemma states that for nondegenerate critical points, there exist coordinates for which the function locally coincides with its second Taylor polynomial at the origin. The index of the Hessian matrix completely classifies the nondegenerate critical points of a smooth real-valued function on <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span>.</p>
<p>A function with only nondegenerate critical points is known as a <strong>Morse function.</strong> Morse functions are dense in the space of smooth functions, <em>i.e.,</em> a generic function only includes nondegenerate critical points and a degenerate critical point decomposes into nondegenerate ones upon an infinitesimal perturbation of the function. As such, Morse functions play a fundamental role in both mathematics and many applications. Given these observations, one might doubt the relevance of the classification of degenerate points. However, as it turns out, degenerate critical points do frequently occur in applications when considering a family of continuously varying functions. Catastrophe theory extends Morse lemma to degenerate critical points. It describes the possible equivalence classes, determines how many terms in the Taylor series are required to distinguish a critical point, and shows how a critical point <strong>unfolds</strong> into nondegenerate critical points under a general perturbation.</p>
<h2 id="catastrophe-theory">Catastrophe theory</h2>
<p>Consider a continuous family of smooth function <span class="math inline">\(f_\boldsymbol{u}:U \to \mathbb{R}\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> a open subset of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span> and with the external parameter <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{u} = (u_1,u_2,\dots, u_d)\)</span>. René Thom’s main theorem of catastrophe theory states that when the number of external parameters does not exceed four (<span class="math inline">\(d \leq 4\)</span>), each ‘stable’ degenerate critical point is equivalent to one of the <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{7}\)</span> elementary catastrophes</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[x^3, x^4, x^5, x^6, x^3 + y^3, x^3 - x y^2, \text{ and } x^2 y + y^4,\]</span></p>
<p>up to coordinate transformations. These elementary catastrophes are known as the <strong>fold, cusp, swallowtail, butterfly, elliptic umbilic, hyperbolic umbilic,</strong> and <strong>parabolic umbilic</strong> catastrophes. The second major theorem of catastrophe theory describes how these degenerate critical points decompose into nondegenerate ones upon small perturbations. The <strong>unfolding</strong> of a critical point is <strong>versal</strong> when it includes all the possible ways in which the degenerate critical can decompose. The unfolding is <strong>universal</strong> when it is both versal and only uses a minimal number of parameters.</p>
<p>Before describing the proofs of these theorems, we colloquially apply the theory to several physical toy models to introduce the relevant concepts.</p>
<h3 id="physical-systems-with-catastrophes">Physical systems with catastrophes</h3>
<p>Catastrophe theory is manifest in many mechanical systems which reside in equilibrium, locally minimizing the potential energy. This is known as <strong>quasistatics</strong>. We will here describe a few applications for which the potential energy includes degenerate critical points, a point in configuration space at which a small perturbation can lead to catastrophic changes in the behaviour. However, catastrophe theory can also be found in other systems, including more general problems in mechanics and optics. This is not surprising as classical physical systems extremize the action and optical systems extremize the travel time.</p>
<h4 id="cylinder-on-a-inclined-slope">Cylinder on a inclined slope</h4>
<p>Consider an inhomogeneous cylinder on an inclined slope for which the centre of mass is located off centre. For convenience, let’s consider a unit cylinder with unit mass, for which the centre of mass a radius <span class="math inline">\(0 &lt; r &lt;1\)</span> from the centre of the cylinder, on an inclined hill with slope <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>. In this problem, the angle <span class="math inline">\(\Theta\)</span> between the horizontal line and the line joining the centre of mass <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> and the centre of the cylinder is the dynamical variable. Note that the angle <span class="math inline">\(\Theta\)</span> uniquely determines the position of the cylinder on the slope. The angle of the slope <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is the external parameter.</p>
<p>Depending on the slope <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, we can distinguish four configurations. For a shallow slope, the system has two equilibrium configurations for which the centre of mass <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> is above the point of contact <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> (two left panels of figure 2). The configuration for which the centre of mass is below (above) the centre of the cylinder corresponds to a global minimum (maximum) of the potential energy. When the slope is increased above a critical value, equilibrium configurations disappear (the right panel of figure 2). The cylinder will roll down the hill. At the critical slope <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_c\)</span>, the two stable equilibrium configurations merge (see the central right panel of figure 2). This configuration, known as a fold catastrophe, is a special configuration, as an infinitesimal increase in the angle <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> leads to a catastrophic change in the dynamics of the system. This is the <em>final straw that broke the camel’s back</em>.</p>

<p>To quantify the system, note that the potential energy of the system <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> is the gravitational potential of the centre of mass <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>. When the cylinder is rolled uphill by an angle <span class="math inline">\(\Theta_0\)</span>, we observe that the centre of the cylinder is raised by a distance <span class="math inline">\(\Theta_0 \sin \alpha\)</span> while the centre of mass moves down with respect to the centre of the cylinder by a distance <span class="math inline">\(r\sin \Theta_0\)</span>. The potential energy of the system is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[V(\Theta, \alpha) = \Theta \sin \alpha - r \sin \Theta + \cos \alpha.\]</span></p>
<p>According to the equation of motion</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{\mathrm{d}^2\Theta}{\mathrm{d}t^2} = -\frac{\partial V}{\partial\Theta} = -\sin \alpha +r \cos \Theta\]</span></p>
<p>the cylinder is in an equilibrium configuration when</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\cos \Theta = \frac{\sin \alpha}{r}.\]</span></p>
<p>For <span class="math inline">\(\alpha &lt; \alpha_c\)</span>, with the critical angle <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_c=\arcsin r\)</span>, this equation has two real solutions corresponding to global maximum and minimum of <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>. For <span class="math inline">\(\alpha &gt; \alpha_0\)</span>, there is no stable configuration. Expanding the potential energy around the angle <span class="math inline">\(\alpha = \alpha_c\)</span>,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[V(\Theta, \alpha) = \frac{r}{6 }\Theta^3 + (\alpha - \alpha_c)\Theta \cos \alpha_c + \cos \alpha + \mathcal{O}(\alpha-\alpha_c),\]</span></p>
<p>we discover the degenerate critical point corresponding to the fold catastrophe. As it turns out, this is the universal unfolding of the fold catastrophe. The normal form of the universal unfolding of the fold catastrophe is</p>

<h4 id="zeemans-catastrophe-machine">Zeeman’s catastrophe machine</h4>
<p>The Zeeman catastrophe machine is a good example of a mechanical system illustrating the cusp catastrophe (first introduced for this purpose by Christopher Zeeman (1969)). Consider a disk with the centre <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> (see figure 4). We allow the disk to freely rotate around its centre. Consider an elastic string connecting a fixed point <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> to a point <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> on the perimeter of the disk to a point <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> (see figure 4). The angle <span class="math inline">\(\Theta\)</span> between the point <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, the centre of the disk <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, and the point <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is the dynamical variable of the system. We observe the behaviour of the system as we change the position of the point <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>. This is the external parameter of the system. We will assume the system to minimize the potential energy of the string.</p>
<figure>
<img src='figures/ZeemanMachine.png' width=100% />
<figcaption>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Let’s gradually vary the position of the point <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>. When the point <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is in the far upper right, the point <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> will be above the centre <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>. When we lower the point <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> to line <span class="math inline">\(AC\)</span> while crossing the red curve, the angle <span class="math inline">\(\Theta\)</span> will gradually change but will remain above the centre <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>. As we lower the point further, we will observe a dramatic change in the angle <span class="math inline">\(\Theta\)</span> when we pass the second red line. The point <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> will all of a sudden move to the lower hemisphere of the disk. This is a fold catastrophe, forming the fold line (red). Other than the situation discussed above, we can observe that the fold line has four non-differentiable points. These points are examples of the cusp catastrophe.</p>
<p>The potential energy of the Zeeman machine is given by</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
V(\Theta, u, v) =&amp;\ \left(\left[ \frac{17}{4} - 2 \cos \Theta\right]^{1/2} -1\right)^2 \\
&amp;\ + \left(\left[(u+a)^2 + v^2 + \frac{1}{4} + (u+a)\cos\Theta - v \sin \Theta\right]^{1/2} - 1\right)^2,
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>with the distance <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> between the points <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>. When we Taylor expand the potential energy around the point <span class="math inline">\((u,v)=(0,0)\)</span> we will discover that the potential energy is quartic in <span class="math inline">\(\Theta\)</span>, corresponding to the cusp catastrophe.</p>
<p>The universal unfolding of the cusp catastrophe is of the form</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[x^4 - u x^2 + v x\]</span></p>
<p>with up to three critical points satisfying the cubic equation</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[4 x^3 - 2u x + v = 0.\]</span></p>
<p>Figure 5 shows the geometry of this unfolding. As with Zeeman’s machine, the cusp caustic has hysteresis. When approaching the region in configuration space corresponding to two angles <span class="math inline">\(\Theta\)</span>, we arrive on either the lower or the upper sheet depending on whether we approached the region from positive or negative <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>.</p>

<p>This can in particular be observed in the geometry of the potential energy for the different configurations (see figure 6). For positive <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> there is only a single minimum. For negative <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>, we observe either a single minimum or a set of three critical points. The two minima correspond to the two possible equilibrium configurations. When we cross a fold line (red), one of the minima merges with the maximum. If the system resided in the local minimum before crossing the fold line, the system will suddenly roll to the global minimum.</p>

<h4 id="caustics-in-optics">Caustics in optics</h4>
<p>Another physical system with catastrophes in the form of caustics can be found in optics. These caustic are regions in space where the intensity spikes and as such play a fundamental role in both lensing and reflection problems. To demonstrate the emergence of the fold and the cusp caustics in optics, consider the reflection of a beam of light by a circular mirror in the geometric approximation (figure 7). The caustic occurs as the envelope of the light paths. This caustic can be observed in the reflection of light in a coffee cup. For more details of the coffeecup caustic see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0411189v1">Symmetries of the Coffeecup Caustic</a> by Brendan Guilfoyle, Wilhelm Klingenberg. This caustic is incidently also relevant to the formation of rainbows. Each raindrop reflects the sun’s rays at its internal spahere to form a cone-like caustic. Different wavelengths lead to a slightly different cone due to the refractive nature of water. This refractive effect leads to the separation of colors which we observe in the sky. There is of course a lot more to the formation of rainbows. For a detailed description see <a href="https://www.perlego.com/book/111558/catastrophe-theory-and-its-applications-pdf">Catastrophe theory and its applications</a> by Tim Poston and Ian Stewart.</p>
<p><strong>Fermat’s principle of least time</strong> provides a natural explanation for the relevance of catastrophes and caustics in optics. A path from the source to a point in space is a classical ray if and only if it is a real critical point of the time it takes to travel from the source to point in space. When the time function <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> has a number of critical points, the point receives light from multiple sources. The caustics correspond to the degenerate critical points of the time function. When the time function scales like <span class="math inline">\(t^3,\)</span> we form a fold. The folds form lines in configuration space. When the time function scales like <span class="math inline">\(t^4,\)</span> the point corresponds to a cusp caustic. These cusps are non-differentiable points on the fold lines.</p>

<p>Morse lemma shows that for nondegenerate critical point of a <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-dimensional function there exist local coordinates for which the function is a sum of quadratic terms, its normal form. In catastrophe theory, mirrors this theorem for degenerate critical points. The reduction lemma (first proved in 1969 by D. Grommoll and W. Meyer) provides a first step towards such a theorem.</p>
<p><strong>Reduction lemma:</strong> <em>Around a degenerate critical point <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{0}\)</span> of a smooth function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> variables with rank <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> and index <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>, there exists a local diffeomorphism <span class="math inline">\(\psi\)</span> preserving the origin, such that the function can be expressed as the sum</em></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f(\psi(\boldsymbol{x})) = f(\boldsymbol{0}) + q_{sr}(x_1,\dots, x_r) +g(x_{r+1},\dots,x_{n}),\]</span></p>
<p><em>where <span class="math inline">\(q_{sr}\)</span> is a nondegenerate normal form in <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> variables, vanishing at the origin, with a critical point at the origin with index <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is a smooth function of <span class="math inline">\(n-r\)</span> variables, vanishing at the origin, with a critical point at the origin that is <strong>totally degenerate</strong> (has vanishing rank). Note that using Morse lemma, we can select coordinates for which</em></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[q_{sr}(x_1,\dots, x_r)  = -x_1^2  -\dots - x_s^2 + x_{s+1}^2+\dots + x_{r}^2.\]</span></p>
<p><em>The function <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is known as the <strong>residual singularity</strong> of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> at <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>.</em></p>
<p><strong>Proof:</strong> <em>The proof of the reduction lemma is based on the diagonalization of symmetric matrices in many textbooks on catastrophe theory. I will here simply refer to chapter three of <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Catastrophe-Theory-Second-Edition/Castrigiano-Hayes/p/book/9780813341255">Catastrophe Theory</a> by Domenico Castrigiano and Sandra Hayes.</em></p>
<p>Using the reduction lemma we can always write a degenerate critical point as a nondegenerate part, classified by the Morse lemma, and a part that is totally degenerate. This reduces the classification of degenerate critical points to the classification of totally degenerate ones. Note that when a degenerate critical point has rank <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, the residual singularity <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> will be a function of <span class="math inline">\(n-r\)</span> variables, known as the <strong>corank</strong> of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. It follows that the corank is a measure of the degree of degeneracy of the critical point.</p>
