<p>Catastrophe theory is the classification of isolated degenerate critical points. The theory is important for a wide range of fields in mathematics and science. However, it can be difficult to get started. While the theorems can be stated in elementary terms, and there are many expositions of the applications, the proofs require a solid foundation in mathematics. In these notes, I will state the main theorems and give a flavour of the underlying mathematics. For a complete, accessible, and rigorous treatment of catastrophe theory I recommend <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Catastrophe-Theory-Second-Edition/Castrigiano-Hayes/p/book/9780813341255">Catastrophe Theory</a> by Domenico Castrigiano and Sandra Hayes to which I will refer in these notes.</p>
<p>A smooth function <span class="math inline">\(f: U \to \mathbb{R}\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> an open subset of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span> including the origin <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{0}\)</span>, has a critical point at the origin when its gradient vanishes at this point, <em>i.e.,</em></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[D f(\boldsymbol{0}) = 
(\partial_1 f(\boldsymbol{0}), \dots, \partial_n f(\boldsymbol{0})) 
=\boldsymbol{0},\]</span></p>
<p>with the partial derivative <span class="math inline">\(\partial_i f = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}.\)</span> The character of the critical point is often determined by the second-order derivative in the form of the Hessian matrix</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[D^2 f(\boldsymbol{0}) = 
\begin{pmatrix}
\partial_{1}^2 f(\boldsymbol{0}) &amp; \partial_1 \partial_2 f(\boldsymbol{0}) &amp; \dots &amp; \partial_1 \partial_n f(\boldsymbol{0})\\
\partial_2 \partial_1 f(\boldsymbol{0}) &amp; \partial_{2}^2 f(\boldsymbol{0}) &amp; \dots &amp; \partial_2 \partial_n f(\boldsymbol{0})\\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots\\
\partial_n \partial_1 f(\boldsymbol{0}) &amp; \partial_n \partial_2 f(\boldsymbol{0}) &amp; \dots &amp; \partial_{n}^2 f(\boldsymbol{0})
\end{pmatrix}.
\]</span></p>
<p>The <strong>rank</strong> – defined as the number of independent rows or columns – and the <strong>index</strong> – defined as the number of negative eigenvalues – of the Hessian matrix are independent of the choice of coordinates. That is to say, a coordinate transformation <span class="math inline">\(g(\boldsymbol{x}) = f(\psi(\boldsymbol{x}))\)</span> – with a diffeomorphism <span class="math inline">\(\psi:U \to V\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> open sets in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span> – preserves the gradient, and the rank and index of the Hessian matrix at the critical point,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
D g(\boldsymbol{0}) &amp;= D f(\boldsymbol{0}) D \psi(\boldsymbol{0}) = \boldsymbol{0},\\
D^2g(\boldsymbol{0}) &amp;=(D \psi(\boldsymbol{0}))^T D^2f(\boldsymbol{0}) (D \psi(\boldsymbol{0})),
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>where the first order derivative of the diffeomorphism <span class="math inline">\(\psi(\boldsymbol{x}) = (\psi_1(\boldsymbol{x}), \dots, \psi_n(\boldsymbol{x}))\)</span> is defined as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[D \psi(\boldsymbol{0}) = 
\begin{pmatrix}

\partial_2 \psi_1(\boldsymbol{0}) &amp; \partial_{2} \psi_2(\boldsymbol{0}) &amp; \dots &amp; \partial_2 \psi_n(\boldsymbol{0})\\

\partial_n \psi_1(\boldsymbol{0}) &amp; \partial_n \psi_2(\boldsymbol{0}) &amp; \dots &amp; \partial_{n} \psi_n(\boldsymbol{0})
\end{pmatrix}.
\]</span></p>
<p>The rank determines whether the critical points is <strong>degenerate</strong> or <strong>nondegenerate</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> <em>A critical point is <strong>nondegenerate</strong> when the Hessian matrix <span class="math inline">\(D^2 f\)</span> is invertable (the rank <span class="math inline">\(r = n\)</span>). When the Hessian matrix is not invertable, the critical point is <strong>degenerate</strong> (the rank <span class="math inline">\(r &lt; n\)</span>).</em></p>
<p>For a nondegenerate critical point, the index distinguishes between the maximum, minimum and saddle points.</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> <em>A nondegenerate critical point is a minimum when the index <span class="math inline">\(s=0\)</span>, a maximum when the index <span class="math inline">\(s=n\)</span>, and saddle point of index <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(0 &lt; s &lt; n\)</span>.</em></p>
<p>As we will show below, the index of a nondegenerate critical point fully classifies the critical point up to coordinate transformations. For degenerate critical points, both the rank and the index play an important role in the classification.</p>
<h2 id="nondegenerate-critical-points">Nondegenerate critical points</h2>
<p>The classification of nondegenerate critical points is expressed by <strong>Morse lemma</strong>, first proven by Marston Morse in 1934. Note that the theorem was already anticipated by Arthur Cayley (1859) and James Clerk Maxwell (1870) in the study of contour lines in topography.</p>
<p><strong>Morse lemma:</strong> <em>Let <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> be a smooth function of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> variables with a critical point at the origin with index <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>. The critical point is nondegenerate if and only if there exists a local diffeomorphism <span class="math inline">\(\psi\)</span> which preserves the origin <span class="math inline">\(\psi(\boldsymbol{0})=\boldsymbol{0}\)</span> for which</em></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f(\psi(\boldsymbol{x})) =f(\boldsymbol{0}) - x_1^2 - \dots - x_s^2 + x_{s+1}^2 + \dots + x_n^2\]</span></p>
<p><em>in the vicinity of the origin.</em></p>
<p><strong>Proof:</strong> <em>The Morse lemma can be proven using the diagonalization of symmetric matrices and the implicit function theory. I provide a detailed proof in the next section. One can also find a proof in chapter one of <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Catastrophe-Theory-Second-Edition/Castrigiano-Hayes/p/book/9780813341255">Catastrophe Theory</a> by Domenico Castrigiano and Sandra Hayes.</em></p>
<p>In the one-dimensional case, the lemma states that any nondegenerate critical points at the origin is either locally equivalent to a maximum <span class="math inline">\(f =f(0) -x^2\)</span> or a minimum <span class="math inline">\(f= f(0) + x^2\)</span> (see figure 1).</p>

<p>More generally, the lemma states that for nondegenerate critical points, there exist coordinates for which the function locally coincides with its second Taylor polynomial at the origin. The index of the Hessian matrix completely classifies the nondegenerate critical points of a smooth real-valued function on <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span>.</p>
<p>A function with only nondegenerate critical points is known as a <strong>Morse function.</strong> Morse functions are dense in the space of smooth functions, <em>i.e.,</em> a generic function only includes nondegenerate critical points and a degenerate critical point decomposes into nondegenerate ones upon an infinitesimal perturbation of the function. As such, Morse functions play a fundamental role in both mathematics and many applications. Given these observations, one might doubt the relevance of the classification of degenerate points. However, as it turns out, degenerate critical points do frequently occur in applications when considering a family of continuously varying functions. Catastrophe theory extends Morse lemma to degenerate critical points. It describes the possible equivalence classes, determines how many terms in the Taylor series are required to distinguish a critical point, and shows how a critical point <strong>unfolds</strong> into nondegenerate critical points under a general perturbation.</p>
<h2 id="catastrophe-theory">Catastrophe theory</h2>
<p>Consider a continuous family of smooth function <span class="math inline">\(f_\boldsymbol{u}:U \to \mathbb{R}\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> a open subset of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span> and with the external parameter <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{u} = (u_1,u_2,\dots, u_d)\)</span>. René Thom’s main theorem of catastrophe theory states that when the number of external parameters does not exceed four (<span class="math inline">\(d \leq 4\)</span>), each ‘stable’ degenerate critical point is equivalent to one of the <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{7}\)</span> elementary catastrophes</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[x^3, x^4, x^5, x^6, x^3 + y^3, x^3 - x y^2, \text{ and } x^2 y + y^4,\]</span></p>
<p>up to coordinate transformations. These elementary catastrophes are known as the <strong>fold, cusp, swallowtail, butterfly, elliptic umbilic, hyperbolic umbilic,</strong> and <strong>parabolic umbilic</strong> catastrophes. The second major theorem of catastrophe theory describes how these degenerate critical points decompose into nondegenerate ones upon small perturbations. The <strong>unfolding</strong> of a critical point is <strong>versal</strong> when it includes all the possible ways in which the degenerate critical can decompose. The unfolding is <strong>universal</strong> when it is both versal and only uses a minimal number of parameters.</p>
<p>Before describing the proofs of these theorems, we colloquially apply the theory to several physical toy models to introduce the relevant concepts.</p>
<h3 id="physical-systems-with-catastrophes">Physical systems with catastrophes</h3>
<p>Catastrophe theory is manifest in many mechanical systems which reside in equilibrium, locally minimizing the potential energy. This is known as <strong>quasistatics</strong>. We will here describe a few applications for which the potential energy includes degenerate critical points, a point in configuration space at which a small perturbation can lead to catastrophic changes in the behaviour. However, catastrophe theory can also be found in other systems, including more general problems in mechanics and optics. This is not surprising as classical physical systems extremize the action and optical systems extremize the travel time.</p>
<h4 id="cylinder-on-a-inclined-slope">Cylinder on a inclined slope</h4>
<p>Consider an inhomogeneous cylinder on an inclined slope for which the centre of mass is located off centre. For convenience, let’s consider a unit cylinder with unit mass, for which the centre of mass a radius <span class="math inline">\(0 &lt; r &lt;1\)</span> from the centre of the cylinder, on an inclined hill with slope <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>. In this problem, the angle <span class="math inline">\(\Theta\)</span> between the horizontal line and the line joining the centre of mass <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> and the centre of the cylinder is the dynamical variable. Note that the angle <span class="math inline">\(\Theta\)</span> uniquely determines the position of the cylinder on the slope. The angle of the slope <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is the external parameter.</p>
<p>Depending on the slope <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, we can distinguish four configurations. For a shallow slope, the system has two equilibrium configurations for which the centre of mass <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> is above the point of contact <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> (two left panels of figure 2). The configuration for which the centre of mass is below (above) the centre of the cylinder corresponds to a global minimum (maximum) of the potential energy. When the slope is increased above a critical value, equilibrium configurations disappear (the right panel of figure 2). The cylinder will roll down the hill. At the critical slope <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_c\)</span>, the two stable equilibrium configurations merge (see the central right panel of figure 2). This configuration, known as a fold catastrophe, is a special configuration, as an infinitesimal increase in the angle <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> leads to a catastrophic change in the dynamics of the system. This is the <em>final straw that broke the camel’s back</em>.</p>

<p>To quantify the system, note that the potential energy of the system <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> is the gravitational potential of the centre of mass <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>. When the cylinder is rolled uphill by an angle <span class="math inline">\(\Theta_0\)</span>, we observe that the centre of the cylinder is raised by a distance <span class="math inline">\(\Theta_0 \sin \alpha\)</span> while the centre of mass moves down with respect to the centre of the cylinder by a distance <span class="math inline">\(r\sin \Theta_0\)</span>. The potential energy of the system is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[V(\Theta, \alpha) = \Theta \sin \alpha - r \sin \Theta + \cos \alpha.\]</span></p>
<p>According to the equation of motion</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{\mathrm{d}^2\Theta}{\mathrm{d}t^2} = -\frac{\partial V}{\partial\Theta} = -\sin \alpha +r \cos \Theta\]</span></p>
<p>the cylinder is in an equilibrium configuration when</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\cos \Theta = \frac{\sin \alpha}{r}.\]</span></p>
<p>For <span class="math inline">\(\alpha &lt; \alpha_c\)</span>, with the critical angle <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_c=\arcsin r\)</span>, this equation has two real solutions corresponding to global maximum and minimum of <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>. For <span class="math inline">\(\alpha &gt; \alpha_0\)</span>, there is no stable configuration. Expanding the potential energy around the angle <span class="math inline">\(\alpha = \alpha_c\)</span>,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[V(\Theta, \alpha) = \frac{r}{6 }\Theta^3 + (\alpha - \alpha_c)\Theta \cos \alpha_c + \cos \alpha + \mathcal{O}(\alpha-\alpha_c),\]</span></p>
<p>we discover the degenerate critical point corresponding to the fold catastrophe. As it turns out, this is the universal unfolding of the fold catastrophe. The normal form of the universal unfolding of the fold catastrophe is</p>

<h4 id="zeemans-catastrophe-machine">Zeeman’s catastrophe machine</h4>
<p>The Zeeman catastrophe machine is a good example of a mechanical system illustrating the cusp catastrophe (first introduced for this purpose by Christopher Zeeman (1969)). Consider a disk with the centre <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> (see figure 4). We allow the disk to freely rotate around its centre. Consider an elastic string connecting a fixed point <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> to a point <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> on the perimeter of the disk to a point <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> (see figure 4). The angle <span class="math inline">\(\Theta\)</span> between the point <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, the centre of the disk <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, and the point <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is the dynamical variable of the system. We observe the behaviour of the system as we change the position of the point <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>. This is the external parameter of the system. We will assume the system to minimize the potential energy of the string.</p>
<figure>
<img src='figures/ZeemanMachine.png' width=100% />
<figcaption>
Fig. 4 - The Zeeman catastrophe machine
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Let’s gradually vary the position of the point <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>. When the point <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is in the far upper right, the point <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> will be above the centre <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>. When we lower the point <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> to line <span class="math inline">\(AC\)</span> while crossing the red curve, the angle <span class="math inline">\(\Theta\)</span> will gradually change but will remain above the centre <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>. As we lower the point further, we will observe a dramatic change in the angle <span class="math inline">\(\Theta\)</span> when we pass the second red line. The point <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> will all of a sudden move to the lower hemisphere of the disk. This is a fold catastrophe, forming the fold line (red). Other than the situation discussed above, we can observe that the fold line has four non-differentiable points. These points are examples of the cusp catastrophe.</p>
<p>The potential energy of the Zeeman machine is given by</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
V(\Theta, u, v) =&amp;\ \left(\left[ \frac{17}{4} - 2 \cos \Theta\right]^{1/2} -1\right)^2 \\
&amp;\ + \left(\left[(u+a)^2 + v^2 + \frac{1}{4} + (u+a)\cos\Theta - v \sin \Theta\right]^{1/2} - 1\right)^2,
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>with the distance <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> between the points <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>. When we Taylor expand the potential energy around the point <span class="math inline">\((u,v)=(0,0)\)</span> we will discover that the potential energy is quartic in <span class="math inline">\(\Theta\)</span>, corresponding to the cusp catastrophe.</p>
<p>The universal unfolding of the cusp catastrophe is of the form</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[x^4 - u x^2 + v x\]</span></p>
<p>with up to three critical points satisfying the cubic equation</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[4 x^3 - 2u x + v = 0.\]</span></p>
<p>Figure 5 shows the geometry of this unfolding. As with Zeeman’s machine, the cusp caustic has hysteresis. When approaching the region in configuration space corresponding to two angles <span class="math inline">\(\Theta\)</span>, we arrive on either the lower or the upper sheet depending on whether we approached the region from positive or negative <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>.</p>

<p>This can in particular be observed in the geometry of the potential energy for the different configurations (see figure 6). For positive <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> there is only a single minimum. For negative <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>, we observe either a single minimum or a set of three critical points. The two minima correspond to the two possible equilibrium configurations. When we cross a fold line (red), one of the minima merges with the maximum. If the system resided in the local minimum before crossing the fold line, the system will suddenly roll to the global minimum.</p>

<h4 id="caustics-in-optics">Caustics in optics</h4>
<p>Another physical system with catastrophes in the form of caustics can be found in optics. These caustic are regions in space where the intensity spikes and as such play a fundamental role in both lensing and reflection problems. To demonstrate the emergence of the fold and the cusp caustics in optics, consider the reflection of a beam of light by the right hemisphere of a circular mirror in the geometric approximation (figure 7). For the reflection by a complete circular mirror see figure 8. The caustic occurs as the envelope of the light paths. This caustic can be observed in the reflection of light in a coffee cup. For more details of the coffeecup caustic see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0411189v1">Symmetries of the Coffeecup Caustic</a> by Brendan Guilfoyle, Wilhelm Klingenberg. This caustic is incidentally also relevant to the formation of rainbows. Each raindrop reflects the sun’s rays at its internal sphere to form a cone-like caustic. Different wavelengths lead to a slightly different cone due to the refractive nature of water. This refractive effect leads to the separation of colours which we observe in the sky. There is of course a lot more to the formation of rainbows. For a detailed description see <a href="https://www.perlego.com/book/111558/catastrophe-theory-and-its-applications-pdf">Catastrophe theory and its applications</a> by Tim Poston and Ian Stewart.</p>
<p><strong>Fermat’s principle of least time</strong> provides a natural explanation for the relevance of catastrophes and caustics in optics. A path from the source to a point in space is a classical ray if and only if it is a real critical point of the time it takes to travel from the source to point in space. When the time function <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> has <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> of critical points, the point receives light from <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> light rays. The caustics at which the intensity spikes directly correspond to the degenerate critical points of these time function. Note that when the time function at the degenerate critical point scales like <span class="math inline">\(t^3,\)</span> it forms a fold caustic. The fold catastrophes form lines in configuration space. When the time function scales like <span class="math inline">\(t^4\)</span> at the degenerate critical point, the point corresponds to a cusp caustic. The cusp is realized as a non-differentiable point on a fold line.</p>

<p>We here give a sketch of catastrophe theory. We will explain the concepts in several steps.</p>
<h4 id="the-reduction-lemma">The reduction lemma</h4>
<p>Morse lemma shows that for any nondegenerate critical point of a <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-dimensional function there exist local coordinates for which the function is a sum of quadratic terms, its normal form. Catastrophe theory mirrors this theorem for degenerate critical points. The reduction lemma (first proved in 1969 by D. Grommoll and W. Meyer) provides the first step towards this goal.</p>
<p><strong>Reduction lemma:</strong> <em>Around a degenerate critical point <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{0}\)</span> of a smooth function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> variables with rank <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> and index <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>, there exists a local diffeomorphism <span class="math inline">\(\psi\)</span> preserving the origin, such that the function can be expressed as the sum</em></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f(\psi(\boldsymbol{x})) = f(\boldsymbol{0}) + q_{sr}(x_1,\dots, x_r) +g(x_{r+1},\dots,x_{n}),\]</span></p>
<p><em>where <span class="math inline">\(q_{sr}\)</span> is a nondegenerate normal form in <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> variables, vanishing and with a critical point at the origin with index <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is a smooth function of <span class="math inline">\(n-r\)</span> variables, vanishing and with a critical point at the origin that is <strong>totally degenerate</strong> (has vanishing rank). Note that using Morse lemma, we can select coordinates for which</em></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[q_{sr}(x_1,\dots, x_r) = -x_1^2 -\dots - x_s^2 + x_{s+1}^2+\dots + x_{r}^2.\]</span></p>
<p><em>The rank and the index completely classifies the nondegenerate part of the critical point. The function <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is known as the <strong>residual singularity</strong> of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> at <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{0}\)</span>.</em></p>
<p><strong>Proof:</strong> <em>The proof of the reduction lemma is based on the diagonalization of symmetric matrices and can be found in many textbooks on catastrophe theory.

<p>Using the reduction lemma we can always write a degenerate critical point as a nondegenerate part, classified by the Morse lemma, and a totally degenerate part. This reduces the classification of degenerate critical points to the classification of totally degenerate ones. Note that when a degenerate critical point has rank <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, the residual singularity <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is a function of <span class="math inline">\(n-r\)</span> variables. This quantity plays an important role in catastrophe theory and is known as the <strong>corank</strong> of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. It follows that the corank is a measure of the degree of degeneracy of the critical point. When the corank vanishes, the critical point is nondegenerate. When the corank is unity, it suffices the classify a totally degenerate critical point in a single variable. When the corank is two, we need to look for the classification of a totally degenerate critical point in two variables.</p>
<h4 id="local-equivalence-classes">Local equivalence classes</h4>
<p>To develop a classification of totally degenerate critical points up to coordinate transformations, we need to develop some algebraic notation. First, we will develop a notion of locality known as the <strong>germ</strong> of the function. The germ allows us to restrict attention to the behaviour of the function in the vicinity of a point <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{p}\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> <em>For <span class="math inline">\(m,n\in \mathbb{N}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{p} \in \mathbb{R}^n\)</span>, consider the set of smooth functions</em></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\{f:U \to \mathbb{R}^m | U \text{ an open set in } \mathbb{R}^n \text{ including the point } p\}.\]</span></p>
<p><em>Two functions in this set <span class="math inline">\(f_1:U_1 \to \mathbb{R}^m\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f_2:U_2\to \mathbb{R}^m\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{p} \in U_1 \cap U_2\)</span>, are defined to be equivalent <span class="math inline">\(f_1 \sim f_2\)</span>, when they coincide on the overlap of their definition, i.e., <span class="math inline">\(f_1|_{U_1 \cap U_2} =f_2|_{U_1 \cap U_2}.\)</span> Locally, <span class="math inline">\(f_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span> are indistinguishable. Using this equivalence relation, we construct the <strong>germ</strong></em></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[[f] =\{ g:U \to \mathbb{R}^m| g \sim f\}\]</span></p>
<p><em>of functions locally indistinguishable to <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. We define <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\mathcal{E}}_{n,m}\)</span> as the set of germs of functions from <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\to \mathbb{R}^m\)</span> at the origin <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{0}\)</span>. For convenience we use the shorthand <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\mathcal{E}}\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(m=1\)</span>.</em></p>
<p>It can be easily shown that the space of germs <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\mathcal{E}}\)</span> inherits the algebraic structure of the space of functions. Given the constant <span class="math inline">\(\alpha \in \mathbb{R}\)</span> and the functions <span class="math inline">\(f_1:U_1 \to \mathbb{R}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f_2:U_2 \to \mathbb{R}\)</span>, we define the addition</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ [f_1] + \alpha [f_2] \equiv [f_1|_V + \alpha f_2|_V]\]</span></p>
<p>and multiplication of germs as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ [f_1][f_2] = [ (f_1|_V) (f_2|_V)],\]</span></p>
<p>with <span class="math inline">\(f_i|_V: V \to \mathbb{R}\)</span> the restriction of <span class="math inline">\(f_i\)</span> to the overlap <span class="math inline">\(V= U_1 \cap U_2\)</span>. From these definitions it follows that the algebra <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\mathcal{E}}\)</span> has a zero <span class="math inline">\([0]\)</span> and an unit germ <span class="math inline">\([1]\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> are interpreted as the constant functions <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}\)</span> defined by <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{x} \mapsto 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{x} \mapsto 1\)</span>. A germ <span class="math inline">\([f] \in \boldsymbol{\mathcal{E}}\)</span> is invertible with the inverse <span class="math inline">\([1/f]\)</span> if and only if <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> does not vanish at the origin. In this case, there exists a open neighborbood of the origin for which the recipical <span class="math inline">\(1/f\)</span> is well defined.</p>
<p>The notion of a germs is a very powerful algebraic construct, as it implements a very concrete notion of locality. However, germs can be difficult to work with in practice. For smooth functions, it is natural to develop a more practical notion of locality using the famous Taylor series,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[T(f) \equiv \sum_{\boldsymbol{\nu} \in \mathcal{N}_0^n} \frac{1}{\boldsymbol{\nu}!} D^\boldsymbol{\nu} f(\boldsymbol{0}) \boldsymbol{x}^\boldsymbol{\nu},\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\nu}\)</span> is a multi-tuple <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\nu}=(\nu_1,\dots, \nu_n)\)</span> with the factorial defined as <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\nu}! = \nu_1!\dots \nu_n!\)</span>, the natural power defined as <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{x}^\boldsymbol{\nu} = x_1^{\nu_1} \dots x_n^{\nu_n}\)</span> and the derivative <span class="math inline">\(D^\boldsymbol{\nu}\)</span> defined as the product of the <span class="math inline">\(\nu_i\)</span>-th partial derivative in the <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> direction for <span class="math inline">\(i=1,\dots, n\)</span>. The Taylor series of two equivalent functions in a germ are identical since if <span class="math inline">\(f \sim g\)</span> then <span class="math inline">\(D^\boldsymbol{\nu} f(\boldsymbol{0}) = D^\boldsymbol{\nu} g(\boldsymbol{0})\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\nu}\)</span>. However note that two functions with equal Taylor polynomials are not necessarily in the same term. For example, the Taylor series of the constant function <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and the function <span class="math inline">\(e^{-1/x^2}\)</span> coincide, but the two functions are not in the same germ at <span class="math inline">\(x=0\)</span>. Alternatively, the two functions <span class="math inline">\(f(x)=x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g(x)=2(e^x-1)\)</span> are equivalent in the neighborhood of the origin, but do not have the same Taylor series.</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> <em>Two germs <span class="math inline">\([f]\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\([g]\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\mathcal{E}}\)</span> are <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-equivalent if the <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-th order Taylor series coincide, i.e., <span class="math inline">\(D^\boldsymbol{\nu} f(\boldsymbol{0}) =D^\boldsymbol{\nu} g(\boldsymbol{0})\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-tuples <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\nu} \in \mathbb{N}_0^n\)</span> for which <span class="math inline">\(|\boldsymbol{\nu}| = \nu_1 + \dots + \nu_n \leq k\)</span>. The set of all germs <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-equivalent to the germ <span class="math inline">\([f]\)</span> is called the <strong><span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-jet</strong> of <span class="math inline">\([f]\)</span>. We write the <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-jet as <span class="math inline">\(j^k[f]\)</span>. The set of all <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-jets in <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\mathcal{E}}\)</span> is the jet-space <span class="math inline">\(J^k\)</span>.</em></p>
<p>Two germs are in the same <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-jet when their <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-th order Taylor series coincide. Conversely, we can define this jet space <span class="math inline">\(j^k[f]\)</span> as the space of germs of smooth functions with the <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-th Taylor series</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[T^k(f) \equiv \sum_{\boldsymbol{\nu} \leq k} \frac{1}{\boldsymbol{\nu}!} D^\boldsymbol{\nu} f(\boldsymbol{0}) \boldsymbol{x}^\boldsymbol{\nu}.\]</span></p>
<p>This is a more practical notion of locality as it is fully determined by a finite number of coefficients.</p>
<p>The germs and jet space provide a notion of locality for functions. To classify the nondegenerate critical points of a function upon the equivalence class of local coordinate transformations, we need a local notion for the coordinate transformations. Define the group <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\mathcal{G}}\)</span> of germs <span class="math inline">\([\psi]\)</span> of local diffeomorphisms <span class="math inline">\(\psi\)</span> at the origin leaving the origin invariant. The product of two such germs <span class="math inline">\([\varphi], [\psi] \in \boldsymbol{\mathcal{G}}\)</span> is defined germ of the composition <span class="math inline">\([\varphi][\psi] = [\varphi \circ{} \psi]\)</span> where the diffeomorphism are restricted to a sufficiently small open neighborhood of the origin. We can easily proof that the set <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\mathcal{G}}\)</span> is indeed a group, with the identity element <span class="math inline">\([\text{id}]\)</span> defined by <span class="math inline">\(id:x \mapsto x\)</span> and where every element <span class="math inline">\([\psi]\)</span> has an inverse <span class="math inline">\([\psi^{-1}]\)</span>.</p>
<p>The group of local diffeomorphism germs <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\mathcal{G}}\)</span> acts on the space of function germs <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\mathcal{G}}\)</span> by the composition action</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\boldsymbol{\mathcal{E}} \times \boldsymbol{\mathcal{G}} \to \boldsymbol{\mathcal{E}}: ([f],[\psi]) \mapsto [f\circ{} \psi],\]</span></p>
<p>where we restrict the function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and the diffeomorphism <span class="math inline">\(\psi\)</span> to the appropriate overlaps. This finally allows us to define the appropriate notion of equivalence up to coordinate transformations.</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> <em>Two function germs <span class="math inline">\([f]\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\([g]\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\mathcal{E}}\)</span> are <strong>equivalent</strong> if there is a diffeomorphism germ <span class="math inline">\([\psi]\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\mathcal{G}}\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\([g] = [f][\psi]\)</span>. The set of all function germs equivalent to <span class="math inline">\([f]\)</span> is known as <strong>the orbit of <span class="math inline">\([f]\)</span> under <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{G}\)</span></strong>,</em></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[[f]\boldsymbol{\mathcal{G}} \equiv \{[f][\psi] | [\psi] \in \boldsymbol{\mathcal{G}}\}.\]</span></p>
<p>In terms of this more sophisticated language, we see that the Morse lemma states that the germ of a nondegenerate critical point at the origin, vanishing at the origin, is in the orbit of one of the normal quadratic forms <span class="math inline">\(q_{sn}(\boldsymbol{x})=-x_1^2 - \dots - x_{s}^2 + x_{s+1}^2 + \dots + x_n^2\)</span>.</p>
<p>Given the two notions of locality, we can study when the two notions agree.</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> <em>A germ <span class="math inline">\([f] \in \boldsymbol{\mathcal{E}}\)</span> is called <strong><span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-determined</strong> if every germ that is <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-equivalent to <span class="math inline">\([f]\)</span> is equivalent to <span class="math inline">\([f]\)</span>. A germ is <strong>finitely determined</strong> if it is <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-determined for some <span class="math inline">\(k &lt; \infty\)</span>. When a germ <span class="math inline">\([f]\)</span> is finitely determined, then the smallest <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> for which <span class="math inline">\([f]\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-determined is refered to as the <strong>determinancy of <span class="math inline">\([f]\)</span></strong> and denoted by <span class="math inline">\(\text{det}[f]\)</span>. When the germ <span class="math inline">\([f]\)</span> is infintely determined we write <span class="math inline">\(\text{det}[f] = \infty\)</span>.</em></p>
<p>To study germs in terms of jet-spaces we need to know: when is a germ <span class="math inline">\([f]\in \boldsymbol{\mathcal{E}}\)</span> finitely determined and how do we determine the determinacy of <span class="math inline">\([f]\)</span>? When we can answer these questions, we have reduced the notion of locality to the study of a finite number of coefficients in the <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-th order Taylor series!</p>
<p>We can answer this using the algebraic notion of the maximal and the Jacobi ideals.</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> <em>The maximal ideal <span class="math inline">\(m^k\)</span> is defined as all germs for which the first <span class="math inline">\(k-1\)</span> order derivatives vanish</em></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[m^k=\{[f] \in \boldsymbol{\mathcal{E}}| D^\boldsymbol{\nu} = 0\text{ for all } |\boldsymbol{\nu}|&lt;k\}.\]</span></p>
<p>We can also write this ideal as <span class="math inline">\(m^k = \langle x^\boldsymbol{\nu}| |\boldsymbol{\nu} = k\rangle\)</span>. Note that <span class="math inline">\(m^{k+l} = \langle m^k m^l\rangle\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> <em>The <strong>Jacobi ideal <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\mathcal{J}}[f]\)</span></strong> of a germ <span class="math inline">\([f] \in \boldsymbol{\mathcal{E}}\)</span> is the ideal of <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\mathcal{E}}\)</span> generated by the germs of the partial derivatives <span class="math inline">\(D_if\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(i=1,\dots, n\)</span>, i.e.,</em></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
\boldsymbol{\mathcal{J}}[f] &amp;= \langle D_1f,\dots,D_n f\rangle\\
&amp;= \{ [ D_1f] [g_1] + \dots + [D_n f] [g_n]| [g_i] \in \boldsymbol{\mathcal{E}}\}.
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>This finally allows us to link the equivalence in terms of germs to the equivalence in terms of the Taylor series.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem:</strong> <em>The germ <span class="math inline">\([f]\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-determined when the ideal <span class="math inline">\(m^k\)</span> is contained in the ideal <span class="math inline">\(\langle m \boldsymbol{\mathcal{J}} \rangle\)</span>, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(m^k \subset \langle m \boldsymbol{\mathcal{J}} \rangle\)</span>.</em></p>
<p><strong>Proof:</strong> <em>For the proof I refer to chapter four of <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Catastrophe-Theory-Second-Edition/Castrigiano-Hayes/p/book/9780813341255">Catastrophe Theory</a> by Domenico Castrigiano and Sandra Hayes.</em></p>
<h4 id="thoms-theorem">Thom’s theorem</h4>
<p>Thom’s classification of critical points applies to germs with are at most <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span>-codimensional. The codimension of a germ is here the number of parameters required to describe the universal unfolding of the germ. For germs with codimension higher than <span class="math inline">\(7\)</span>, the classification becomes more involved as we are required to consider families of catastrophes, known as <strong>unimodular germs</strong>. Formally,</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> <em>Let <span class="math inline">\([f]\)</span> be a germ in <span class="math inline">\(m^2\)</span>. The codimension of the germ is defined as</em></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{cod}[f] \equiv \text{dim } m / \boldsymbol{\mathcal{J}}[f].\]</span></p>
<p>It can be shown that the notion of codimension is independent of the choice of coordinates, <em>i.e.,</em> two equivalent germs (which can be transformed into each other with a diffeomorphism germ) have the same codimension. Not surprisingly, the codimension is related to the corank of a function. When the codimension of a nondegenerate critical point is between <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span>, the corank will be either <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>. Using the reduction lemma, we can thus reduce the classification to totally degenerate critical points in one and two variables.</p>
<p>Using these tools, it can be proven that every degenerate critical point with at most codimension <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span> is equivalent to one of the <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{7}\)</span> elementary catastrophes</p>

<p>This concludes Thom’s original formulation of catastrophe theory. It is possible to extend the classification to critical points with higher codimension using the same techniques.</p>
<h3 id="proving-some-theorems">Proving some theorems</h3>
<p>To complete the classification theorem but keep the flow of the reasoning, we here give some proves of some of the lemmas and theorems.</p>
<p><strong>Morse lemma:</strong> <em>Let <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> be a smooth function of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> variables with a critical point at the origin with index <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>.

<p><span class="math display">\[f(\psi(\boldsymbol{x})) =f(\boldsymbol{0}) - x_1^2 - \dots - x_s^2 + x_{s+1}^2 + \dots + x_n^2\]</span></p>
